# TODO
* GUI
* Sound effects
    * Dice bouncing against walls and other dice
    * Round start, scoring, bust
* Better scoring
    * triple doubles
    * fix straight bug (should always consume best hand first instead of straights.)
* Particle effects or smoke on collision
* Special dice - wilds
* More dice shapes - coin, d12
* Levels, enemies?
* Rewards after levels
* Visualize stabilization forces.
* Physics robustness and optimization.

## Card Ideas
* Common:
    * Increment, Decrement, and Flip (opposite die side value)
* Uncommon:
    * Reroll
    * Draw 2
    * Discard 1, Draw 3
    * Replenish used die
* Rare
    * Sacrifice for a bonus life
    * Sacrifice to draw an additional card every turn

## Relic Ideas
* Straights give 2x points
* Straights only need 4 in a row
* Pairs are legal
* Dice can contribute to multiple hand types
